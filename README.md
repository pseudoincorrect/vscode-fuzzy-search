# VSCode Fuzzy Search Telescope Extension

A fast and intuitive fuzzy search extension for Visual Studio Code, inspired by vim telescope. Provides powerful text search capabilities with a clean split-pane interface.

## Features

### üîç Dual Search Modes
- **Current File Search** (`Ctrl+Shift+F` / `Cmd+Shift+F`): Search within the active file
- **Workspace Search** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`): Search across all files in the workspace

### ‚ö° Advanced Fuzzy Matching
- Smart word boundary prioritization (e.g., "Err" matches "ErrInvalidInput")
- CamelCase-aware matching for better code navigation
- Real-time highlighting of matched characters
- Backtracking algorithm for optimal match scoring

### üñ•Ô∏è Split-Pane Interface
- **Top pane**: List of matching lines with fuzzy highlighting
- **Bottom pane**: Code context surrounding the selected line
- Familiar vim telescope-style navigation

### üöÄ Performance
- Built on `ripgrep` for blazing-fast text search
- Incremental search results as you type
- Optimized for large codebases
